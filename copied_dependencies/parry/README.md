## What is Parry?

**Parry** is a set 2 and 3-dimensional geometric and collision detection libraries.
These libraries are `parry2d`, `parry3d`, `parry2d-f64`, and `parry3d-f64`. They are written with the Rust
programming language, by the [Dimforge](https://dimforge.com) organization. It is forever free
and open-source!

## Roadmap
This year, Parry does not have a dedicated roadmap. So our goal right now is to add
to Parry whatever is needed for our [Rapier](https://rapier.rs) physics engine to
complete its own [2021 roadmap](https://www.dimforge.com/blog/2021/01/01/physics-simulation-with-rapier-2021-roadmap/#rapier-roadmap-for-2021).
We regularly give updates about our progress on [our blog](https://www.dimforge.com/blog).
